# Foosball Front-End

# Installation
### Get the source code
Make a directory for your project.  Clone or download and extract the starter in that directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/Foolish-Foosballers/Foosball-Front-End.git
```

### Install tools
If you don't have them already, you'll need node, bower and gulp to be installed globally on your machine.  

1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  This includes npm - the node package manager.  
2. Install [bower](https://bower.io/) globally `npm install bower -g`  
3. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally `npm install gulp-cli -g`  

### Install the dependencies
Change directory into the new project you just cloned, then install dependencies.
```
npm install
bower install
```
## Running the app locally
The default gulp task will start a local web server.  Just run this command:
```
gulp
```
Browse to http://localhost:5000.
